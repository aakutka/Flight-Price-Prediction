# Flight-Price-Prediction
The Aim is to apply the ML models to predict the flight price depending upon the various Inputs
Downloaded and Preprocess the Dataset. A
Applied EDA and Feature engineering to represent the data in the best required form
Applied various ML models and predict which is the best among all .


Training File shows the application od fifferent ml models 
EDAImpolement shows the implementation of various Implementation parts

Feature file shows how the feature engineering has been applied to get the results
